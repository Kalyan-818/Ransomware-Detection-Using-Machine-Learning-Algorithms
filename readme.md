Main aim of the project is to detect malicious activity or to detect the right hash code when
the transaction done while the transfer of any bitcoins in the blockchain. When the transfer 
of any bitcoin to validate transaction using SHA256 algorithm unique code is generated.
That unique code is placed to check  the transaction is malicious or valid transaction.

Random forest classifier is used to train the model to get better accuracy for better result.
